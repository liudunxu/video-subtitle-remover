# CLUADE.md

This file intentionally mirrors the Vast.ai operating convention from
`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`. It exists because the user explicitly referenced this
spelling.

## Vast.ai Instance Operations

Use this convention for this project's GPU API deployment:

- Stable Vast.ai label prefix: `video-subtitle-remover-api`
- Default instance label: `video-subtitle-remover-api-mvp`
- Service port inside container: `6006`
- Docker Hub image tag: `liudunxu/video-subtitle-remover:vast-gpu`
- Prefer resolving the Docker Hub tag to the current linux/amd64 digest before creating a Vast.ai instance, then pass `liudunxu/video-subtitle-remover@sha256:<digest>` to Vast.ai.
- Runtime type: `args`
- Default disk: `70`
- Required env:
  - `-p 6006:6006=1`
  - `HOST=0.0.0.0`
  - `PORT=6006`
  - `VSR_REQUIRE_GPU=1`
  - `VSR_API_WORK_DIR=/workspace/video_subtitle_remover_api`
  - `XDG_CACHE_HOME=/workspace/.cache`
  - `MPLCONFIGDIR=/workspace/.cache/matplotlib`
  - `PADDLE_PDX_DISABLE_MODEL_SOURCE_CHECK=True`

When the user says "关闭vast.ai实例" or equivalent:

- Query current Vast.ai instances with `VAST_API_KEY`.
- Delete every running/loading/stopped Vast.ai instance whose `label` starts with `video-subtitle-remover-api`.
- Do not delete instances with other labels.
- Report the deleted instance ids and confirm no matching instances remain.

When the user says "开启vast.ai实例" or equivalent:

- Query current Vast.ai instances first.
- If a matching `video-subtitle-remover-api*` instance is already running, reuse it and report its public URL.
- Otherwise search verified rentable on-demand offers for one RTX 3090 with at least 24GB VRAM, at least one direct port, and enough disk space.
- Prefer US/CA offers with good reliability and network; avoid machines that recently failed Docker Hub pulls.
- Create exactly one instance using label `video-subtitle-remover-api-mvp`.
- After creation, poll until `actual_status=running` and port `6006/tcp` is assigned.
- Verify `GET /health` on the public URL and read Vast logs to confirm `GPU runtime check passed`.
